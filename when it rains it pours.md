when it rains it pours

build a game about water management

use plants to absorb water over time, available water gets replenished by rain, you need to have enough plants to absorb all rain?

similar to timberborners there are dry and wet periods
however the wet periods are rain and can come earlier or later and also vary in intensity
maybe wet periods are influenced by amount of water that evaporates from plants/earth

different ground tiles
brown dirt - let's water through, allows slow evaporation, allows plants, takes medium damage from water
red clay - does not let water through, allows slow little evaporation, allows some plants, takes a little damnage from water
sand? - lets water through, allows quick evaporation, allows some plants, takes a lot of damaged from water
stone - does not let water through, allows almost no evaporation, allows moss only, takes very little damage from water

tetris????? or maybe deck drawing???

point gathering card game
players have their own deck and always have to have 5 cards in their hand
there is a central event deck

player decks have
bucket
bottle of oil
jar
tomato
watermelon
rice

event deck has
5rain - 1 to 3 - combine with bucket to get bucket o water
6sun - 1 to 3 - combine with bucket o water to get bucket, combine with watered plant to get dry plant, combine with plant to get sundried plant (gives almost no points)
7hail - 1 - combine with any plant to kill it
10bloom - 1 - combine with watered plant to get matured plant
11preserve - 1 to 3
12harvest 1 to 3 - combine with matured plant and grannary to secure points
steal (fox card for fun) - allows a player to steal from another player

game plays in rounds; player:
draws event card

- if rain, sun or hail - HAS to combine with a card (from their hand or their prepared cards), if they cannot they must discard a card and draw a new one (and repeat until they can combine?)
